Hey my love, Aastha ❤️

I can't believe it's already our 3rd month together, but honestly, it feels like we've known each other for 30 years! You know me better than anyone else, and I feel so lucky to have you in my life. These months have been nothing short of magical, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for us.

I know you’re heading to Jaipur, and while it’s going to be tough being apart, I’m confident we’ll make it through this. Whether it’s Mumbai to Jaipur or anywhere else, I’m ready to conquer the distance with you. We’ll find a way to stay close no matter what. I’m constantly thinking about you and I miss you like crazy, but that’s just a reminder of how much I care for you.

And as for your future, I know you're going to be the best physiotherapist in the world! Your passion and dedication are truly inspiring. I believe in you, Aastha, more than you know, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. This is just a small gesture to remind you of how much you mean to me and how excited I am to see all the amazing things you’ll achieve.

Let’s keep making this journey of ours beautiful. No matter the distance, you’ve always got my heart. 💕

Missing you always,
Akshat 💫
